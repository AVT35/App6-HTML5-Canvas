Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of the code is to create a drawing canvas that fits a phone screen. There will be three buttons in this website. When the first button is pressed, 
the border will be drawn on the canvas. When the second button is pressed, there will be an image loaded onto a screen, and when a third button is pressed, the 
screen will clear (image will disappear) and leave a blank screen.
